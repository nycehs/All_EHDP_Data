The numbers in this table include all children tested within a given calendar year, regardless of whether they were tested in previous years with the same or different blood lead levels. While children can receive more than one test during the calendar year, children are only counted once using the highest confirmed blood lead level during the calendar year. If the child does not have a confirmed test in a given year, the child’s blood lead level is based on the highest capillary or unknown test type. This measure differs from the rate of children newly identified with blood lead levels at or above a certain level reported by the Health Department in other publications. <a href=\"http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/EPHTPDF/Childhood_Lead_Exposure_Definitions_June_2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Read more </a>about different measures used by the Health Department for surveillance of childhood lead poisoning.",
